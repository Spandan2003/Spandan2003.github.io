<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px"> Welcome to my AI/ML Journey! </span>

Hi, I’m Spandan Anaokar. I grew up in India with an endless curiosity for how things work, which led me to study Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay and eventually pursue a Master’s in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. Along the way, I discovered my fascination for Artificial Intelligence — not just as a field of study, but as a way of thinking about problems, systems, and even people.

Outside academics, I’ve always tried to keep life colorful. I enjoy the quiet intensity of chess, the thrill of basketball games, the escapism of thriller novels, and the imagination of anime. These interests keep me grounded and creative, reminding me that learning doesn’t only happen in classrooms or labs.

This site is a little window into my journey — the projects I’ve worked on, the ideas I’m exploring, and the things that inspire me. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy looking around.
