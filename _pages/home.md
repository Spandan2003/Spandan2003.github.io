<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Welcome to my AI/ML Journey!</span>


I am Spandan Anaokar, a fourth-year student in the Engineering Physics Department at [IIT Bombay](www.iitb.ac.in), with a strong passion for the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Throughout my academic journey, I have been captivated by the potential of AI/ML to revolutionize industries and solve complex problems. With a current CGPA of 9.5, I strive for excellence in my academic pursuits and am eager to expand my knowledge in this rapidly evolving field.

On this website, I invite you to join me on my journey as I delve deeper into the realms of AI and ML. Explore my projects, research interests, and insights gained through coursework and independent explorations. Together, let's unravel complex algorithms, extract meaningful insights from data, and contribute to the ever-growing field of AI.
