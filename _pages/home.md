<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Hello there!</span>

I am an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), where I am currently doing a BTech in Engineering Physics. I am highly interested in Thoreotical Research and cracking tricky problems. My degree is in Engineering Physics, and thus quite research-oriented. It is thorough in regards to how to approach a research problem and the critical thinking required to solve it that is vastly different than anything I had seen before.<br> 

I am presently doing a Minor in Computer Science that has ignited my passion towards research in Computer Science. My strong interest in Computer Science is what compelled me to make this website as a way to get people to know me. My current interests are in the field of Formal Verification and Automata Theory. I have done a course on Logic(CS228) which teaches the common logic used like FO, MSO and LTL. Currently, I am doing another course as a sit-through(CS719) which contains an algebraic approach to formal verification using set theory in general.
