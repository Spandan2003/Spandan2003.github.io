<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Hello there!</span>

I am an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am currently doing a BTech in Engineering Physics, a very research-oriented branch. I am highly interested in Thoreotical Research and cracking tricky problems. .<br> 

I am presently doing a Minor in Computer Science that has ignited my passion towards research in Computer Science. My strong interest in Computer Science is what compelled me to make this website as a way to get people to know me. My current interests are in the field of Logic and Automata Theory and mostly Formal Verification. I have done a course on Logic([CS228](/courses)) which teaches the common logic used like FO, MSO and LTL. Currently, I am doing another course as a sit-through([CS719](/courses)) which contains an algebraic approach to formal verification using set theory in general.
