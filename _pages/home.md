<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Hello there!</span>

I am an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am currently doing a BTech in Engineering Physics, a very research-oriented branch. I am highly interested in Thoreotical Research and cracking tricky problems.<br> 

I am doing a Minor in Computer Science. I am interested in a vide variety of topics. Presently, I am most interested in the area of Formal Verification. I have studied Logic and Automata Theory learning multiple logics like FO, MSO, LTL and DFA's and $\omega$-Automata using BÃ¼chi Acceptance Condition, and smart use of 2-player games to prove Closure of complement of NFA's. I am also learning an algebric approach to Automata Theory using Semigroups, Monoids and Set Theory.
