<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Hello there!</span>

I am an 2<sup>nd</sup> year undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), currently doing a BTech in Engineering Physics, a very research-oriented branch. I love learning new things and using innovative logic to solve stuff.

At the start of my 2<sup>nd</sup> year, I got equally interested in Thereotical Computer Science and Formal Verification. My Minor is in Computer Science and so am doing loads of CS courses. I am putting a lot of efforts in this subject and greatly enjoying it right now.

I am an avid reader (read Harry Potter series 10 times over) and love watching anime and stuff. Playing games and listening to music is my relaxation. Mystery and Crime is where I would go if I didn't do Engineering(I meant a Detective).

Here are the links to the [Courses](/courses) I have taken and [Projects](/projects) I have done. You can contact me by clicking on the icons at the bottom of the page.
