      <h6>January '23 - April '23</h6>
    </div>  
    <ul>
        <li>Revises Logics like First Order Logic, Monadic Second Order Logic, Linear Temporal Logic and their corresponding Automata theories</li>
        <li>Uses Semigroup, Monoids and Set Theory to inference an automata from a monoid divided into equivalence classes each of which correspond to a state.</li>
        <li>Uses various Theorems like Green's theorem in order to build upon this theory giving rise to a lot of interesting characteristics.
