  description: We developed a Transformer and Temporal Convolution Network-based model to predict the timing of the next action in smart homes. The model incorporates RBF and Time2Vec embeddings to effectively capture temporal dynamics. By reformulating the regression problem as a classification task, we achieved a 10% improvement in accuracy and significantly reduced RMSE across multiple datasets, enhancing the reliability of smart home automation systems.
